# TransferAndSplit
This program will transfer all of your JPEG and RAW files into two separate folders 

It is meant for FUJI cameras that save both RAW and JPEG files to the same folders. This program will allow you to easily transfer all files as well as splitting them into a folder for JPEG's and a folder for RAW's

In order to run this, you must first install python and tqdm. Once python has been installed, install tqdm (used for progress bar) with the following command: pip3 install tqdm

To run, open a command line, get into the directory of the python file and run it with: python3 main.py 

If you have any problems with this program, feel free to add me on discord at: Dragon Enjoyer#1101

Hope you find this program useful!! <3
